- Inventory menu needs to have a good UI, perhaps reminiscent of band-likes.
    > On that note, finish the menu templates ( menutemplate.txt )
- Consider reducing code bloat from busywait. ( slp() and busywait() are incompatible )
- Proper skill/spell/stat tableing ( data is also incomplete )
- Make better attempt at building files platform-independently ( windows sux tho:/ )
- Consider whether GMP is REALLY needed.
- Figure out how to use libbf for more accurate floats ( might help wait accuracy, although not crucial )
    > libbf would likely aid in stat calculation
- Implement more commands, like "cast", "status", "inv"/"item"
    > Synonym database?
- Implement single-key input ( recommended steps not working, path unclear )
- How to use magic.lua? ( should contain rules for magic, but necessary structure is unclear )
- CREATE MORE MONSTERRRS
- Figure out how memorytest.lua works, and gain insight
- ! Reduce memory leakage.
    > Garbage collection is fine for now, but main loop should not be accumulating variables in memory without input.
- {Maybe use ncurses to shift into Unicode and back again}
