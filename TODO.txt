- ! Swap CENTER indices to have X value first. Not SUPER crucial, but can get confusing
- Inventory menu needs to have a good UI, perhaps reminiscent of band-likes.
    > ! On that note, finish the menu templates ( menutemplate.txt )
- Consider reducing code bloat from busywait. ( slp() and busywait() are incompatible )
- Create standard order for listing & reading monster info from files
- Make better attempt at building files platform-independently ( windows sux tho:/ )
- Figure out how to use src/lib/gmp.lua ...
- Synonym database for commands?
- Implement single-key input ( recommended steps not working, path unclear )
    > link ncurses when compiling. Also, refer to ncurses_examples/ for help.
- How to use magic.lua ? ( should contain rules for magic, but necessary structure is unclear )
- CREATE MORE MONSTERRRS
- Figure out how memorytest.lua works, and gain insight <-- in progress
- ! Reduce memory leakage.
    > Garbage collection is fine for now, but main loop should not be accumulating variables in memory without input.
- {Maybe use ncurses to shift into Unicode and back again}
- Regarding animations, "dirty rect" erasing+drawing technique should be utilized where possible
- at some point, reduce redundant color code writing to minimize writebuffer
- ! have method that stores previous coordinate separate from built-in "save cursor" escape code
- Circle drawing using sine calculations seems slow ( sqrt function? )
