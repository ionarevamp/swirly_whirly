- Inventory menu needs to have a good UI, perhaps reminiscent of band-likes.
    > On that note, finish the menu templates ( menutemplate.txt )
- Consider reducing code bloat from busywait. ( slp() and busywait() are incompatible )
- Proper skill/spell/stat tableing ( data is also incomplete )
- Make better attempt at building files platform-independently ( windows sux tho:/ )
- Figure out how to use libbf for more accurate floats ( might help wait accuracy, although not crucial )
    > libbf would likely aid in stat calculation
- Implement more commands, like "cast", "status", "inv"/"item(s)"
    > Synonym database?
- Implement single-key input ( recommended steps not working, path unclear )
- How to use magic.lua? ( should contain rules for magic, but necessary structure is unclear )
- CREATE MORE MONSTERRRS
- Figure out how memorytest.lua works, and gain insight
- ! Reduce memory leakage.
    > Garbage collection is fine for now, but main loop should not be accumulating variables in memory without input.
- {Maybe use ncurses to shift into Unicode and back again}
- ! Implement screen buffer akin to code in testnova.lua
- ! Lua/LuaJIT has faster I/O buffer calls than C, so writing functions should be handled by Lua
    > port functions from C, as well as creating buffer-equivalent funcs 
    > ! create method for concatenating all buffer characters into single string to minimize write steps
- ! have method that stores previous coordinate separate from built-in "save cursor" escape code
