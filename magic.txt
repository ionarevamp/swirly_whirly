ETHERIC PROPERTIES OF MAGIC:
    {dev note: these are just the "commonly understood" forms of magic,
        so the ones seen here may be not all-encompassing}
    - Primary (basic) forms of magic:
        - heat : produce some kind of energy from mana, such as fire
            (simplest and most intuitive form of magic)
        - null : nullification of energy, like ice or darkness,
            using more mana depending on amount nullified.
            (HOWEVER, this energy does not disappear. It converts
            ambient mana via the nullification)
        - space : ability to adjust physical space and forms,
            as in teleportation or pocket dimensions
            (easiest, best usage is redirection while more skilled
            users might use gates or warps)
        - motion : ability to move things with a maximum amount
            of weight/inertia with consistent mana consumption
            (most intuitive usage is wind magic)
        - force : a more instant version of motion, i.e. application
            of a lot of force at once at the cost of a lot of mana
            (most intuitive usage is force push and earth-shaping)
        

    - Secondary magics:
        - heat null : absorb own mana. Useful for meditation/rest
            - max effect depends on lower of 2 affinities
        - heat space : more precise expulsion of energy
            - heat controls intensity, space controls accuracy
        - heat motion : swifter expulsion of energy
            - motion controls rapidity
        - heat force : explosive energy release of some sort
            - each aspect contributes to its own damage type
        - null space : pockets of negative energy
            - null controls intensity, space controls area size
        - null motion : allows for swift absorption of physical momentum
            - null controls max effect, motion controls speed of effect
        - null force : allows for brief translocation of energy from source
            - null controls max energy, force controls strength of effect
        - space motion : move arbitrary space as if it were an object
            - space control size of space, motion controls max distance
        - space force : allows for contraction and expansion of a space
            - space controls size of space, force controls speed
        - motion force : use force magic across greater distances
            - damage = force/distance(motion)
    - Tertiary magics:
        - heat null space : Remote access of energies
            - effectsize = (lesser of heat, null) - distance
        - heat null motion : Move energies across a space
            - effectsize = (lesser of heat, null)+motion
        - heat null force : Force energy towards a direction or point
            - effectsize = (lesser of heat, null)+force
        - heat space motion : Highly swift and precise expulsion of energy
            - heat controls intensity, space controls max range,
                motion controls max speed
        - heat space force : Converge energy on one point or area quickly
            - heat controls intensity, space controls area size,
                force controls max compression (endsize = (startsize+energy)-force)
        - heat motion force : Quickly expel energy to larger area
            - Like heat+force, but has trajectory
        - null space motion : Larger, more precise, moving pockets of
            negative energy
            - null controls max negativity, space controls area size,
                motion controls movement speed
        - null space force : allows for instant translocation of energy
           between two spaces
            - null controls max energy, space controls max area, force
                controls speed of translocation
        - null motion force : allows for fast absorption of momentum
            within a moveable space
            - null is negativity, motion is speed of motion, force
                is speed of absorption
        - space motion force : Precise application of large amount of
            force to an area
            - space controls max energy density/area for a given shape,
                motion controls speed of effect, force is max energy
    - Quaternary magics:
        - heat null space motion : remote control and access of energies
            at great distance
            - (lesser of heat, null) controls max energy shift,
                space controls max range, motion controls max rate
        - heat null space force : remote, brief direction of energy from one
            location to another
            - (lesser of heat, null) controls max energy shift, space
                controls range, force controls speed (higher magnitude than motion)
        - heat null motion force : Move an amplified energy across a space
            near-instantly
            - (lesser of heat, null) controls max energy shift,
            motion reduces randomness, force controls baseline energy
        - heat space motion force : quickly condenses energy to a small, 
            moveable point, then releases energy towards target
                - heat is intensity, space is both phase 1 & 2 range,
                    motion is move/aim speed, force is maximum energy
        - null space motion force : Everything inside a specified,
                moveable space quickly gains negative energy and
                momentum
                - null controls negativity, space controls area size,
                motion controls speed of area movement, force amplifies
                speed and and intensity of effect
    - Pentultimate (NOT "Penultimate," as that would be quaternary)
        - Also called Mythic Magic, or Divine Charms by laymen
        - ALL basic magics in one: HEAT+NULL+SPACE+MOTION+FORCE
            - This magic does not technically exist for most, rather
                the manifestation of this "magic" that is life,
                especially that of mundane creatures.
            - For example, one creature's pentultimate ability
                may be breathing fire at will while another's
                might be visualizing magical flows intrinsically
            - There are exceptions where intelligent/highly skilled
                creatures can combine each temper of magic to restore
                objects, others, or themselves
            - Theoretically, one with a grasp on using all types
                of magic at once could create any number of effects
                not yet dreamt
            - Though much history is lost, it is thought that many
                unexplained artifacts and charms are pentultimate magic
                manifest

SPELLS, CHARMS, AND HOW THEY RELATE TO MAGIC:
    - SPELLS AND RITUALS:
        - First off, spells themselves do not cause magic to happen.
            One may recite a spell all day long but if the incantor
            is not moving their mana, nothing will happen outside of
            the sounds and movements being made (depending on the 
            spell, of course.)
        - Rituals are similar to spells, in that is simply a physical
            series of actions which are associated with some effect.
            However, rituals are considered to be more complicated
            and to have more stringent requirements for success, such
            as needing multiple people or particular, rare ingredients.
        - Assuming all requirements are met, one can string together
            various etheric reactions to produce emergent (and potentially
            spectacular!) effects. A simple, popular example is the
            fireball, a skillfull application of creating 'heat' from
            mana, and applying 'motion'.
        - Strictly speaking, incantations are never necessary for
            producing magical effects. One may move their mana in the
            correct way if they know exactly how to create an effect.
            However, spells can be seen as a shortcut to magic that 
            simplify the process of learning and remembering the
            movement of mana, also known as 'circulation'.
    - CIRCULATION:
        - To circulate mana, one must be in touch with it. To be in
            touch, one must sense it. To sense it, one must accept
            the flow of possibilities within you. That is, if one
            were to 'meditate' on their existence they might
            eventually gain access to their own mana.
    - CHARMS:
        - Charms can be thought of as a physical representation of
            a spell. It may not be clear which magics were used to
            create a particular charm to the user, but it is
            generally accepted that enchanters cannot accomplish the
            impossible and use magic that does not exist.
        - The materials required to create a charm are as follows:
            - An anchor, preferably one appropriate to the type
                of magic.
            - An accurate idea or visualization of the intended
                spell to take effect.
            - Any materials to enhance the symbolism of the charm
                and therefore some part of the magical effect.
            - The knowledge and mana required to cast the intended
                spell, plus the mana required to bind the spell.
            - Finally, the method of binding magic to the given
                object which differs across situations.
    - FINAL NOTES: 
        - Mana capacity and affinity changes between creatures and
            individuals, and may change based on one's experiences.
