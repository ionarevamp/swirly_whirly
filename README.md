# BANDING (repository name is placeholder)

- Goal: Semi-2D text adventure RPG with semi-open world and different display modes.
This project is currently in the beginning stages, and a fork or some type of separate release will be created for the first roughly playable version (mainly for purposes of comparison and orienting the overall direction of the project.)
The meaning of "roughly" in this context is TBD.

It should also be noted that this is a project being pursued with learning in mind, and if a good game is made as a result, well, that's cool too.
